##UDPChatApp WPF C# .Net 4.7 Demo Example
Just messing around in WPF to create a modern looking Win32 UI for our UDP Chat demo. The UI/UX will be polished in the coming weeks, and in the future, may be used as a template for other people who also want to create modern feeling Win32 apps, but are unsure where to start. In the coming weeks we will also be releasing some WPF templates showing how to create a glow, drop shadow, rounded corners, and a custom drawn title bar. We absolutely hate WPF and wish Microsoft would create something significantly simpler for creating modern present day apps in Visual Studio. Our pleas likely go unheard, but some exciting developement has occured with the collaberation of the WinUI3 repo.
This app is part of our \#JustPublishIt initiative, encouraging developers to just publish what they have, and polish it with further commits. Publishing is different than creating buggy releases, the concept is to spread community contributions where things would otherwise never be published at all.
